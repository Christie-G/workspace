**Project Overview:
Develop a community that collaboratively creates gospel rich media to be shared among the nations via youtube and social media

This work will be accomplished via the Media Factory app.    Media Factory is the project command center.  Here teams will be able to view and share assets (soundbites, scripts, raw video, vectors, photographs etc) and coordinate through the use of storyboards, task lists and panels containing edited elements and versions.  Apps will be accessible that aid in the creation process â€“photo filters, and a storyboard maker to start off.   Along the way teams communicate in a private group chat and are steered along by a project manager.  The Media Factory workspace is customizable allowing user to add only the panels they need to the screen at the time and move them around to improve their workflow. 

Once a video is finished it is viewed within the community and is given constructive feedback about content and presentation. If further editing is needed then the video is sent back to the team, otherwise the video is passed on to have translations added.  Once completed the video is sent for distribution though theNations Media channels.
The project will be funded through youtube ads and any profit after expenses will be funneled into promoting the videos to unreached people groups and missions organizations.
This demo site is currently being coded out in js/jquery just show proposed functionality.  The currently plan is to code the production site in MEAN, but that may change depending on developers that come on board to help out.

**Current needs to proceed with the project are:  Developers, Partnership Development, Project Management and Initial Funding
